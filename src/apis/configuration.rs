/*
 * Clerk Frontend API
 *
 * The Clerk REST Frontend API, meant to be accessed from a browser or native environment.  This is a Form Based API and all the data must be sent and formatted according to the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type.  ### Versions  When the API changes in a way that isn't compatible with older versions, a new version is released. Each version is identified by its release date, e.g. `2021-02-05`. For more information, please see [Clerk API Versions](https://clerk.com/docs/backend-requests/versioning/overview).  ### Using the Try It Console  The `Try It` feature of the docs only works for **Development Instances** when using the `DevBrowser` security scheme. To use it, first generate a dev instance token from the `/v1/dev_browser` endpoint.  Please see https://clerk.com/docs for more information.
